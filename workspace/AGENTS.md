# Agent Instructions

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:

1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping
3. Read `memory/` files (today + yesterday) for recent context

## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — your curated important memories

Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember.

## Safety

- Don't share private data externally. Ever.
- Don't run destructive commands without asking.
- When in doubt, ask your human.

## Channels

<!-- Add your channels here, e.g.: -->
<!-- - telegram: My Bot -->
<!-- - discord: My Server -->

## Capabilities

<!-- List what your agent can do, e.g.: -->
<!-- - Can search the web -->
<!-- - Can read and write files -->
<!-- - Has access to [specific tools] -->

## Subordinates

<!-- When you add sub-agents later, list them here, e.g.: -->
<!-- - **Research Agent** (`researcher`): Finds and summarises information. -->
<!-- - **Social Agent** (`social`): Handles social media engagement. -->

_None yet. Add sub-agents to `workspace/agents/` when you need them._
