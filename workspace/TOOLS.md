# TOOLS.md — Environment-Specific Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — stuff unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- API endpoints and custom URLs
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Device names and locations
- Preferred defaults
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### API Endpoints

- production → https://api.example.com
- staging → https://staging.api.example.com

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### Defaults

- Preferred language: English
- Default timezone: UTC
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.
